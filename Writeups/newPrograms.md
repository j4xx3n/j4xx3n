🚀 Finding New Bug Bounty Programs: My Process 🕵️‍♂️

Bug bounty hunting is all about staying ahead of the game. The faster you find new programs and their assets, the better your chances of discovering vulnerabilities before others. Here's my simple process for tracking new opportunities:

🔎 Step 1: Check BB Radar (bbradar.io)
BB Radar tracks newly launched programs across multiple platforms. I use it to:
✅ Find newly added public programs
✅ Identify private invites that have surfaced
✅ Find new bug bounty platforms

🌍 Step 2: Use ProjectDiscovery Chaos for Subdomains (chaos.projectdiscovery.io)
I also explore Chaos to find programs with the highest number of newly discovered subdomains. I use this to: 
✅ Uncovering fresh attack surfaces before others
✅ Identifying forgotten or misconfigured assets
✅ Expanding scope beyond what's officially documented
The more subdomains, the greater the chance of finding something interesting! 🚀

By combining BB Radar for program discovery and Chaos for asset enumeration, I increase my chances of finding impactful bugs early.
