## **Custom Wordlist Scan**

##### **Which wordlist should I use?**

- [Reference](https://github.com/nikitastupin/clairvoyance#which-wordlist-should-i-use)

There are at least three approaches:
- Use one of the [wordlists](https://github.com/Escape-Technologies/graphql-wordlist) collected by Escape Technologies
- Use general English words (e.g. [google-10000-english](https://github.com/first20hours/google-10000-english)).
- Create target specific wordlist by extracting all valid GraphQL names from application HTTP traffic, from mobile application static files, etc. Regex for GraphQL name is [`[_A-Za-z][_0-9A-Za-z]*`](http://spec.graphql.org/June2018/#sec-Names).

- [ ] **Cewl**
```bash
cewl https://example.com:8080/ -w cewl.txt
```
- [ ] **Scan**
```bash
clairvoyance https://example.com/graphql -o example.json -w cewl.com
```

**Notes**
```
